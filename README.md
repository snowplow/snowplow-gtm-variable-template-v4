# GTM Custom Variable Template for JavaScript Tracker v3

## Overview

This is the Google Tag Manager [custom variable template](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/templates) for v3 of the [Snowplow JavaScript tracker](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-javascript-tracker).

The **Snowplow v3 Settings** variable template lets you deploy, implement, and configure the Snowplow JS tracker on the website using Google Tag Manager.

It has been designed to be used with the [Snowplow v3 custom template](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-gtm-tag-template-v3).

## Quickstart

This template is available in the [GTM Template Gallery](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/). Installation should be done directly in your GTM container, instructions can be found in the [Tag Manager documentation](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9454109?hl=en).

## Maintainer Quickstart

Work on the template should be done in Google Tag Manager's native **template editor**. This is to ensure the template has access to all the latest features of the template editor, and to make sure it passes GTM's own validation when exporting the changes.

To **import** the template into Google Tag Manager:

1. In a Google Tag Manager **web** container (any container will do), browse to **Templates** and click to create a new template.
2. From the template action menu, choose **Import**.
3. Locate the `template.tpl` file from this repo, and import it into the template editor.

Make the changes you wish. Make sure the unit tests pass (in the **Tests** tab of the editor). Update the tests if necessary.

Once you're done, follow these steps:

1. **Save** the template in the template editor.
2. From the action menu, choose **Export**.
3. Replace the `template.tpl` file in this repo with the exported file (make sure to keep `template.tpl` as its name)..
4. **Commit** the changes to the `template.tpl` file.
5. Copy the **commit hash**.
6. Edit `metadata.yaml` in the template folder, and add the hash with its `changeNotes` as the latest version.
7. Move the previous latest version into the list of `Older versions`.
8. Save changes to `metadata.yaml` and **commit** them.
9. Finally, push the changes to the repo (should include the commit to `template.tpl` and the commit to `metadata.yaml`).

After pushing the changes, Google Tag Manager should update the template in the [community gallery](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/) within some hours to some days.
